# Description of the geometry

This section describes briefly the geometry, with a particular focus
on the names of the physical volumes of the various sources.


:::{note}
The renderings on this page use the public geometry (see {doc}`cfg-geometry`).
:::

The geometry is divided in various assemblies, as described in {doc}`vis`.

## HPGe strings

The `strings` assembly consists of the HPGe detectors and their support structure.

This is shown below:

&nbsp;

The left figure above shows the HPGe detectors, as explained in {doc}`naming` these
are given physical volume names of the **detector name** (i.e. `V99000A`).

The center shows the detector holder structure. This is divided into several parts:
- the pen baseplates for each detector, with physical volume names `pen_{NAME}` 
where `{NAME}` is the detector name 
:::{note} These are shown in yellow, green, red and blue in the rendering depending on the size
:::
- for some detectors there are also top pen rings named `pen_top_{NAME}`,
- the HPGe detectors are supported by a copper support structure, all parts of this structure are 
made of electroformed copper and have physical volumes prefixed with `hpge_support_structure`.
- nylon minishrouds surronding each string, these have a name starting in `minishroud`, and calibration
tubes which have names `calibration_tube_{IDX}` where `{IDX}` is the index of the SIS (see {doc}{cfg-`calibration`}).

:::{warning}
Some components of the HPGe readout chain, (electronics cables etc.) are not yet implemented!
:::

The hpge copper support structure consists of three components:
- a copper rod supporting each string (shown at the top of the rendering), these have names:
```
hpge_support_copper_string_support_structure_string_{STRING}
``` 
where `{STRING}` is the string number,
- a triangular copper support for each string (or "tristar") named
```
hpge_support_copper_tristar_{SIZE}_string_{STRING}
``` 
where `{SIZE}` is the size of the string 
(`small`,`medium`, `large`, or `xlarge`).
- copper rods for each HPGe detector which have names:
```
hpge_support_copper_string_{STRING}_cu_rod_{IDX}
```
where `{IDX}` is an index of the rod.

:::{tip}

To select all copper parts in _remage_ you can use a wildcard `hpge_support_copper.*` and similarly 
to select all copper rods, tristar or string support structures.

## Top plate

The `top` assembly consists of the top plate holding the CC4 electronics, currently this is a single
physical volume called `top_plate`.

This is shown on the left figure of the rendering below.

## Fiber's and SiPMs

The fiber shroud's for the LAr readout are shown in the right figure above.

As mentioned in {doc}`runtime-cfg` there are two modes for the optical fibers,
either individual fibers or a segmented option.

In both cases the fiber volumes are divided into 4 parts:
- an outer TPB coating,
- two layers of cladding,
- the fiber core.

The optical fiber system consists of a large number of physical volumes,
to enable concise _remage_ macros the names are
